Adds a Masonry layout to all built-in WordPress Galleries.

== Description ==

[See Demo](http://willrees.com/jquery-masonry-wordpress-gallery-plugin-demo/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=jmig "See Demo")

Adds a Masonry layout to all galleries that are using the WordPress [gallery] shortcode. Looks best on galleries that are not using 1:1 ratio thumbnails.

Now includes optional <strong>Lazy Load for larger galleries</strong> and hover captions!

<strong>Please note:</strong> By default this plugin includes CSS that will overwrite the existing gallery layout. However, you can turn off some or all of the jMIG layout CSS on the options page under Settings.

This plugin also includes 1 CSS file that is for animation purposes only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE 10+). The entire gallery will fade in using a CSS3 animation once all the images have loaded. IE 8 and IE 9 will work, but will not fade in.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jquery-masonry-image-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Jmig options if you need to change settings
4. That's it!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= All of my galleries looked different before I upgraded this plugin to 2.2. Can I change it back? =
Yes. Go to Dashboard -> Settings -> JMIG Options. Check the box DO NOT allow jMIG to add any CSS that modifies your gallery or gallery items, then save.

= The specified amount of columns in the gallery short code is not working. What's wrong?  =

If you are using a fixed layout and/or want Masonry to respect the column count in the gallery shortcode, then go to Settings -> Jmig options and make sure the box is checked and click save.

= All my thumbnails are the same size so they don't stack. Can I fix this? =

Yes. It's actually really easy. Go to the Dashboard -> Settings -> Media. Make sure "Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)" is unchecked. You can also change the size of thumbnails as well. I like to set my thumbnail width between 150px and 250px, then set the height to 9999px. [Then install the Regenerate Images plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) and run it. Now your gallery images will stack.

== Changelog ==
3.0 - Added in an option for Lazy Load. Added in hover captions that are enabled by default, but can be turned off. Includes option to exclude the Lazy Load library to help avoid other plugin or theme conflicts. Also, removed the has_shortcode conditional since it feels like more and more people are putting the gallery shortcode in fields generated by ACF, Meta Fields, etc. Also, started setting up the plugin for multiple language support. Still working through it, hope to have Spanish, German, French and Russian sometime in Summer of 2015.

2.2 - Adds in new layout CSS with the option to turn it off for backwards compatibility
