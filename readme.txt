== Description ==

Applies jQuery Masonry to native WordPress image galleries. jQuery Masonry is included in WordPress, use it for image galleries. Works best on galleries <strong>without</strong> 1:1 scaled thumbnails.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jquery-masonry-image-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= All my thumbnails are the same size so they don't stack. Can I fix this? =

Yes. It's actually really easy. Go to the Dashboard -> Settings -> Media. Make sure "Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)" is unchecked. You can also change the size of thumbnails as well. [Then install the Regenerate Images plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) and run it. Now your gallery images will stack.
